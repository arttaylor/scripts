ImgSrc


--
INTRODUCTION

imgsrc is a tiny program that takes a filename as input, and prints out an
<img src="%s" width=%d height=%d> string.  It will pull the width and height
out of most gif, pcx, png, and jpeg files. The bmp format was too gross to
do in one sitting, so I left it out. You shouldn't be putting bmp files on
your website, anyway.

In case you were wondering, pcx was horrendously easy, which is why I 
bothered to put it in.
