This is a quick Java port of my text "editor" (Hah, I slay myself)
zinsser.rb based on some of the suggestions in Howard Zinsser's On
Writing Well.  I went with pluggable rule sets so I can throw S&W in
there as well as others when I get around to it.  (I.e., you're better
off forking the code.)

mvn package; java -cp target/TextCleaner-1.0.jar com.arttaylor.util.text.cleaner.TextCleaner test-data/test.txt

It definitely reflects my functional programming bent, with as many
immutable data types as possible and side effects limited to the
#main() class.  I tried to be at least reasonably idiomatic with Java.
