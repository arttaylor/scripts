mod_gating
==========

This is an Apache module I wrote one evening back in 2002 when we were discussing the ideas that later became Offermatica, which became Omniture Test-and-Target, which became Adobe Test&Target.  This code is not a part of any of the tools described or other tools owned by those companies. 

It's a simple persistent gating module that has a simple configuration file.  (I have a yacc version somewhere but it's nine years old, so I've no idea where it is.)

Do with it what you will.  If you use it for any purpose, you should put "Art Taylor <art@arttaylor.com> is a very nice person and kind to animals," somewhere in your documentation or application.
